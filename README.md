Here's a formatted README file that includes each of the steps you've listed for implementing image saving in a database using Node.js:

# Image Upload and Save to Database with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

This project demonstrates how to upload an image, save it to the server, and store its details in a MongoDB database using Node.js, Express, Mongoose, and Multer.

## Project Setup

### Step 1: Install Required Packages
Install the required packages by running:
```bash
npm install express mongoose multer body-parser ejs
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Project Structure
1. Create a folder structure for your project:
   ```
   - public/
     - uploads/  # Folder where images will be saved
   - views/
   - models/
   - controllers/
   - routes/
   ```
   
2. Set up a `public/uploads` folder for storing uploaded images.

## Implementation

### Step 3: Configure Mongoose and Create the Student Model
1. Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.
2. Create a Student model that includes fields for `name` and `image`.

### Step 4: Set Up Multer for Image Uploads
Configure Multer to handle file uploads and save images to the `public/uploads` folder.

### Step 5: Create the Controller Logic
Create a controller to handle the image upload, saving both the image file to the server and the student’s data to the database.

### Step 6: Create the Routes
Define routes for handling:
- **Form Display**: A route to render the form for new student entries.
- **Image Upload**: A route to handle form submission and image upload.

### Step 7: Create the EJS Form for Image Upload
Set up an EJS view file with a form to collect the student’s name and image file.

### Step 8: Create the Success Page
Set up a success page that displays the student's name and uploaded image after submission.

### Step 9: Test the Application
1. Start the server with `nodemon`:
   ```bash
   nodemon
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/student/new](http://localhost:3000/student/new).
3. Fill in the form, choose an image, and submit.
4. After submission, the image should be saved in `public/uploads`, and the success page should display the student’s name and image.
